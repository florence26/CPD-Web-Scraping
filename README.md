# CPD-Web-Scraping

As the Promotional Coordinator of the Birmingham Civil Engineering Graduates group, a key part of my role is to produce a monthly list of Continual Professional Development events and webinars. The Jupyter notebook automatically extracts the necessary data in the list onto an Excel spreadsheet so the document can be easily compiled after.

Depending on the month of the year, the month, month_num and month_abbr variables can be changed to obtain the necessary data.
